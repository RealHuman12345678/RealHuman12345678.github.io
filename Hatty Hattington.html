<h3>Hatty Hattington is a character from one of the Behemoth's other games, BattleBlock Theater.
His entire moveset is a reference to his own game, but this caused his character to favor fashion
over function. His splash attack comes out incredibly late, just so it can show the Golden Whale from
his own game. </h3>
