Character Availability: Legend of the Blacksmith DLC
<h3> The Blacksmith has non-elemental magic based around smithing and his frog. He has bad hitboxes on his
splash attack and does not have a multi hit on it, unlike every other character except alien Hominid. 
He also has a different arrow design from the other knights, as it is white instead of brown.</h3>
