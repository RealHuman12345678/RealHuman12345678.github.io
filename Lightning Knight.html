Availability:Starter Character<br>
<h3> Lightning Knight is one of the four starter characters, and it's strong suit is it's pvp capabilities.
It splash attack does massive damage to just a few units, and if you manage to hit it there is nothing they can do(without the aid of pets).
It also has decent range and is probably the best pvp character of them all. However, for story mode it is not that good
because when you use his splash attack, you cannot move, which makes it almost useless on bosses, because they cannot be stunned.
It is fun when playing with friends, but not a good choice for single player. </h3>
