<h3> This character is the only character with the ability to stun enemies, and it's splash attack
goes incredibly far. It has 16 hits on it's splash attack, and each one of them stuns enemies for a shor
period of time. It also has a bright theme with it's magic, but it has no effect on gameplay (except for the stun)
