Character Availability: Beat the game with Gray Knight<br>
<h3>This character is one of many characters with basic non-elemental magic. That means that his magic has
no strengths or weakness, and simply rains down generic arrows and projectiles that do raw damage without 
any special effects. However. this means that the cult minion enemies are not immune to you magic, which
is very helpful because they resist almost every type of magic, so stove-face has an advantage over sme other characters.<h3>
