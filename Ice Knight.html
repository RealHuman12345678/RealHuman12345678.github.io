<h3>Ice Knight is one of the four starter knights, and for the story mode it is most often the best.
It has good crowd clearing capability with his splash attack, and the ability to freeze is one of the best.
It also has an infinite when you cancel the last attack of his element infusion, because he and iceskimo are the only characters that freeze.
However, for pvp it is not amazing, because area of effect damage is not good for one on one situations.
Investing a large amount of magic points is not terrible idea with this character.</h3>
