Character Availability: Starter Character<br>
<h3>This character is one of the 4 starter characters, and is very mediocre all around.
It has decent splash range and good damge, but no specific abilites that sets its apart. 
The poison effect does increases damage and cause for some funny interactions, but it is not an amazing or
a terrible character. On some of the later levels, he has some trouble because there are enemies that are immune
to the poison effect and take less damage from poison enemies. This means that he can only effectively use his melee weapons
and items to beat those levels, but thankfully there are only one or two of those levels. <h3>
