Character Availability: Beat the game with Lightning Knight
<h3>This character is has dark magic as it's element, instead of the undead. This is most likely so the Necromancer
can be a unique character, as it is a DLC character on some platforms. His magic has decent splash and can 
anti-air some enemies with his splash, but other than that he has no very special characteristics.<h3>
