Character Availability:Beat the Barbarian Boss <br>
<h3>Gray Knight is one of the first characters you unlock, as the Barbarian Boss is the second boss(first is the War Machine)
, but the first final one. He has bomb magic, which means he can spawn bombs with his projectile magic infinitely.
This is very helpful because you normally need to purchase bombs to access secret areas and items, but you can do it for free.
The only downside is that bombs are on a timer so in-battle your projectiles will expire midair, which can be a pretty big 
disadvantage. However, they do have area damge when they explode, which no other type of magic has(on it's projectile).</h3>
